- Log system reworked, now duplicates and random rolls without a seed cannot be logged
- Added new log page to display entries because json isn't easy to wade through
- Added -saved parameter, which only rolls from items in the log
- Added blacklist for specific rolls; should reroll if encountered without a seed, but otherwise replaces the stage name.
- Blacklisted rolls can also not be logged

--- 5/8/23 ---
- Parameters now require a dash in front of them (ie !poopster -ro GonGOn), freeing up some words for seeds that were previously reserved.
- Context flag now displays the game that each stage came from.
- Added ability to save rolls to a log file with the "-log" command
- Split up help commands so that they don't immediately flood Twitch chat
- Groundwork in place for update to long-neglected web frontend

- [ro] Corrected "Crushcheck" being split as "Crush/Check"

- Web version updated with seed support and improved context

--- 3/19/23 ---
- Poopster rewritten again (for the third time?)
- Random seed support
